HTML-Template-Pro version 0.47
==============================

DESCRIPTION

Original HTML::Template is written by Sam Tregar, sam@tregar.com
with contributions of many people mentioned there.
Their efforts caused HTML::Template to be mature html tempate engine
which separate perl code and html design.
Yet powerful, HTML::Template is slow, especially if mod_perl isn't 
available or in case of disk usage and memory limitations.

HTML::Template::Pro is a fast lightweight C/Perl+XS reimplementation
of HTML::Template (as of 2.7) and HTML::Template::Expr (as of 0.0.4). 
It is not intended to be a complete replacement, 
but to be a fast implementation of HTML::Template if you don't need 
extended facilities of HTML::Template such as filters or quering.
Designed for heavy upload, resource limitations, abcence of mod_perl.

HTML::Template::Pro has complete support of HTML::Template::Expr's tag
EXPR="<expression>", including user-defined functions.

HTML::Template work cycle uses 2 steps. First, it loads and parse template.
Then it accepts param() calls until you call output().
output() is its second phase where it produces a page from the parsed tree
of template, obtained in the 1st step.

HTML::Template::Pro loads, parse and outputs template on fly, 
when you call $tmpl->output(), in one pass. The corresponding code is 
written in C and glued to Perl using Perl+XS. As a result,
comparing to HTML::Template in ordinary calls, it runs 
10-25 times faster. Comparing to HTML::Template with all caching enabled
under mod_perl, it still 1-3 times faster. At that HTML::Template caching 
requires considerable amount of memory (per process, shareable, or on disk) 
to be permanently filled with parsed trees, whereas HTML::Template::Pro 
don't consumes memory for caches and use mmap() for reading templates on disk.

INSTALLATION

This module is tested on Linux and FreeBSD. There are success reports 
on MacOS X and Solaris. It currently requires POSIX mmap() system call, 
which may be unavaliable on some systems.

To install this module type the following:

   make
   make test
   make install

If you have no libpcre installed try 
   perl Makefile.PL PCRE=0

DEPENDENCIES
