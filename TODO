HTML-Template-Pro TODO.
=======================

The current goal is to separate a C library
and add wrappers for other languages.

The main idea is following:
Core C library should be as language neutral
and portable as possible.

As ANSI C lack standard map types,
the code was designed so that wrapper should use
its own language spacific (as Perl built-in hash)
or library specific (C+glib, for example)
HashOfHash type, and should provide abstract
HashOfHash getters to the core C library
as well as some other system specific calls.

2. Public backend library.
(libhtmltmplpro.so.1.0.0, htmltmplpro.dll)
that can be built independently.

3. A few wrappers for languages other then perl
(php, java, maybe high-level C/glib and C++ wrappers)
to prove the API is designed good enough to fit a vast majority of languages.
